                <p class="bio">
                        Sara Lopes was born in Braga, Portugal, in 1995. For some time, photography was not more than a big passion that was far away from reach. When it was time to choose a career, she decided to go with Journalism.
                        In 2013, Sara enrolled in BA Science of Communication, doing later on an MA in the same field. The pathway through photography came to shape around 2016. The passion for documentary photography was then developed in the MA Photojournalism and Documentary Photography in 
                        London. So far, Sara took part in several exhibitions in London and in Porto.
